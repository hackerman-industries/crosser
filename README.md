# Crosser

This Repo is a React Native application, designed to inform users of the when the train crossing is open or closed.

The Manchester - Buxton train line is home to one of 3 remaining railway crossings which are controlled by operators. When driving on the road, the crossing will be shut if a train is imminently approaching and is opened shortly afterwards to allow cars through. 

This can cause a delay to a car journey, as you have to wait for the trains to pass. In some cases, it may even be faster to go around through Poynton town to get to your destination instead.

This application is designed to inform the user of when the crossing will be open and shut, and based on the train data make a recommendation to the driver on whether to travel over the crossing or detour around it.
